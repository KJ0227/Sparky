    Introduction: Meet Sparky
  </h1>
  <p>
    Sparky is a American Staffordshire Terrier. He was born on March 5, 2023. I adopted him on May 15, 2023. He was originally named Zenith before we renamed him. Ever since that day, he has become the center of my attention. He is full of energy and always wants to play. He has beige and white fur. He used to have bright blue eyes (which are now light green) when he was a baby, which gave him his name.
