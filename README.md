    Introduction: Meet Sparky
  </h1>
  <p>
    Sparky is a <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/american-staffordshire-terrier/">American Staffordshire Terrier.</a> He was born on March 5, 2023. I adopted him on May 15, 2023. He was originally named Zenith before we renamed him. Ever since that day, he has become the center of my attention. He is full of energy and always wants to play. He has beige and white fur. He used to have bright blue eyes (which are now light green) when he was a baby, which gave him his name.

    Sparky's Daily Life
  </h1>
    <P>
      Sparky loves to play everyday, but he also sleeps just as much. A day in the life of Sparky would look something like this:
    </P>
    <li>
      <b>6:30am</b>ðŸ•¡ - Wake up with Krish to get ready for school. Then go back to sleep
    </li>
      <li>
      <b>7:30am</b>ðŸ•¢ - Say bye to Krish and Dad
    </li>
  <li>
    <b>8:30am</b>ðŸ•£ - Eat breakfast
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>9:00am</b>ðŸ•˜ - Say bye to Mom. With the whole house to myself, I take multiple naps, chase and eat a bunch of flies, and bark at anyone that tries to come near my house.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>3:30</b>ðŸ•ž - Krish is back! I usually get zoomies around this time. 
  </li>
  <li>
      <b>5:30</b>ðŸ•  - Mom and Dad are back! Zoomies again!
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>6:00</b>ðŸ•• - Time to go for a walk!
  </li>
